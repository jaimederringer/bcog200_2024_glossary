- **python**: Python is a programming language. It can be used to create interactive programs as well as for efficient and flexible data management and processing.
- **Functions**: code that only runs if it is called upon; requires parameters to either execute an action or return some data back to where you originally called the function.
- **Infinite While Loop**: A while loop that runs (or attempts to run) an infinite number of times because the conditions under which it is running will always be true (i.e. the stop condition is never achieved). 
- **Lists**: A list is a sequence data type, like a string, however any type of Python data can be put inside a list. Lists are declared with square brackets and commans separating each list element. 
- **OOP**: A design of python that is organized around objects and allows for bundling variable functions together. Ex: .append(), .mean() and print() statemens are all parts of OOP.
- **bool variable**: A bool variable, short for Boolean, is a data type that stores True or False.
- **Strings**: Strings are sequences of text in python that are surrounded by either single or double quotes. This is a built in data type for python. 
- **Class**: A Code template for creating objects. Those objects have many functions built into them that associate certain behaviors that the script will run.
